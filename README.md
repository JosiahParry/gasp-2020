# APIs: you're probably not using them and why you probably should

**Abstract**:

> If you venture even momentarily into the world of DevOps you'll quickly hear the phrases like continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), microservice, build automation and a whole slew more. This talk will focus on microservices aka APIs. APIs are an immensely powerful tool for building, managing, and sharing applications. I will emphasize the ability to share code regardless of language, maintainability, modularity, and empowerment of the data scientist.

This lightning talk is prepared for the Government Advances in Statistical Programming (2020) one day virtual workshop.
