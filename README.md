## APIs: you're probably not using them and why you probably should

**Abstract**:

> If you venture even momentarily into the world of DevOps you'll quickly hear the phrases like continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), microservice, build automation and a whole slew more. This talk will focus on microservices aka APIs. APIs are an immensely powerful tool for building, managing, and sharing applications. I will emphasize the ability to share code regardless of language, maintainability, modularity, and empowerment of the data scientist.

This repository and associated talk covers:

- Motivation for using Microservices & APIs
- Reviews the basics of an API
- Creating functions
- Creating plumber APIs
- Deploying to RStudio Connect
- Writing an R Wrapper to an API
